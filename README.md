## Concise description of each paper
The pdf of each paper can be found above.


## Master Thesis
This paper is my report for my Master Thesis, done at Harvard University and supervised by Mathieu Salzmann from EPFL
It studies error correction in axon segmentation.

## SatelliteDetection
This paper studies the detection of satellite tracks in images of the universe produced by a satellite.
We use Deep Leaning to create synthetic data with a GAN. These images are then used to train a UNET for semantic
segmentation.

## OptimizationAlgorithmAnalysis
We study the performance of a second-order optimization method for training a Neural Network, in comparison
with the Gradient Descent algorithm.

## NNfromScratch
We implemented from scratch a deep learning framework without the use of external libraries i.e coding 
both the forward pass and the backpropagation algorithm only with basic Python functions.

## GravitationalLensClassification
We built a CNN to detect gravitational lenses. We reached an accuracy of 91.7%. The model was then used 
by the lab of Astrophysics at EPFL.

## GraphEdgePrediction
This paper presents two algorithms to predict the sign of an edge in a triad of a directed graph. In graph
theory, a triad is a subgraph of three nodes representing a triangle. It is studied for example to understand
social networks.

## BinaryClassification
We implemented different NN models (MLP, CNN, siamese Networks) and compared their performance on a binary
classification task.
